  Dependencies

To build batajelo, please install the dependencies specified in the
install.* files.


=================
     CMake
=================

Ton configure the project, check for dependencies and create the Makefile, you need cmake, and use it like this:

$ cmake .

To compile only the server (for example if you want to run batajelo_server
on a server, without having to install the graphical dependencies), run

$ cmake . -DBUILD_CLIENT=false

You can also only build the client if you want, but this doesnâ€™t avoid any
dependency, it just avoid compiling a few files.

$ cmake . -DBUILD_SERVER=false

Once this is done, with no error, you can compile the project:

$ make
